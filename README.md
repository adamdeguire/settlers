# **Settlers API (Full-Stack Project**

[**View the application here**](https://adamdeguire.github.io/settlers-client/)

## **Introduction**

-----------------------

This project is my first venture into full-stack development. I've created an **Express/MongoDB** back-end API/database wherein a user can:

- Create an account
- Sign in
- Join a lobby
- Leave a lobby and begin a game
- Create and own games
- Update games with the current board data

### **The technical focus of this project is primarily on the following:**

- Client-Server communication via Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (**AJAX**)
- Client-to-client communication using **socket.io**
- CRUD-based API
- Relational databases
